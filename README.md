# zAI - Zero Integration AI writing plugin for minimalists and vimmers

AI made efficient and controllable -- in any text editor,


## Goals:
- 🎯🤖 **Precise control over what the AI is doing**. No need for elaborate natural language 🗣️ descriptions. Control AI precisely with a few ⌨️ macros typed directly in the editor.
- 🌍 **Works for any editor**, supporting almost any unique specific text editor (neovim, Obsidian, Kile, or whatever you need). The editor just needs to support file reloading 🔄.
- 🎓 **Learn once, use anywhere** 🌍 - since it works in any editor, master it once and apply it everywhere.
- ⚡ **Automating text editing with AI** 🤖 - enabling fast, precise workflows 🎯 for tasks like proofreading, refactoring, or correction ✍️.
- 🔑 **Bring your own API** - works with any OpenAI-compatible API, including locally hosted ones 🏠 (e.g., using vLLM).
- 💾 **Store your LLM calls** - save your usage data to potentially finetune your own LLM later 🌱🧠.
- 🆓 **Fully free and open-source** 🔓❤️.
