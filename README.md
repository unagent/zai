# zAI - Zero Integration AI writing plugin for minimalists and vimmers

AI made efficient and controllable in any text editor,


## Goals:
- *Precise control what AI is doing*. No need to write elaborate natural language descriptions. Control AI precisely with few macros typed in editor itself.
- *Works for any editor*, support almost any unique specific text editor (neovim, Obsidian, Kile, or whatever you need). Editor needs to support reloading files.
- *Learn once use anywhere* - if it works in any editor, you can learn it only once and use it everywhere. 
- *Automating text editing with AI* - fast, precise workflow for proofreading, refactoring or correction.
- *Bring your own API* - works for any OpenAI-compatible API including locally hosted with e.g. vLLM.
- *Store your LLM calls* - save your LLM usage to finetune your own LLM.
- *Fully free and open-source*
